= Create Application Backups

In this section we are going to test different scenarios when performing backups. We will be creating four different applications with different features and then we will back them up.

[#app1]
== Application 1

The first application will be a simple `httpd` application. We can create the application as follows:

1. Create a project called `application-01`

----
oc new-project application-01
----

2. Go to the Developer perspective in the OpenShift Console

3. In the developer catalogue choose the application *Apache HTTP Server (httpd)*

4. Fill the `Git Repo URL` by pressing `Try sample` and the `Name` with the desired application name and then click on *Create*

Once the application is up and running, we can perform our first backup. In order to create the backup, in the Administrator view, go to the OADP Operator and then to the Backup section.
